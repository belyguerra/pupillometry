# pupillometry

I use these scripts to process the pupillometry data from the SET task. They reflect a collection of scripts developed by other members of my lab and myself. They are super beta version at the moment and my pipeline is still in flux, so feel free to reach out to me if you find any bugs or have any suggestions!
